# logistic-regression
Using logistic regression to predict a binary outcome.

In this project, I use logistic regression to analyze a dataset of demographic variables taken from banking customers.  I created partitions within the data set for training, validation, and testing.
Then, a logistic regression model is fitted on the "LoanDefault" outcome variable.  Along the way, I created a confusion matrix and plotted the ROC curve.  
Finally, I evaluate the accuracy of the model using an oversampled training set.  The result is the ability to make predictions on loan default for new customers by attaching probability scores to 
new customers added to the dataframe.
